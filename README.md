<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>

All dependencies are listed in _requirements.txt_ file.

1. To install dependencies, run -

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Database - 

        It will take considerable amount of time to scrap all the data present in NDTV website in live time for each request. So, HEROKU POSTGRES DB (flask sqlite can also be used) has been used to store the scrapped data. The database will be feed with latest news present in the NDTV website for every 10 minutes which inturn will feed a pandas dataframe. 

        Once a request is received, it will query the dataframe for the requested data and will provide the JSON response.

3. Start the api server - 
    ```bash
    $ python app.py
    ```
